 CSVs:               Only the pertinent CSV's are in the GitHub repository
 
 They are loaded into the Rmd file in this order when prompted:
 1. Breweries.csv
 2. Beers.csv
 3. Beer_types.csv
 4. 2021-State-Breakdown.csv
 5. 2021-State-Breakdown.csv (for some reason it asks for it twice)
 
 Video Presentation via Zoom is found in the GitHub repo:  Budweiser_presentation.mp4
 
 My partner on this project was Lani Lewis and I want to thank her for her diligent efforts.  She is a very smart lady.  We worked together very well.  Thank you Lani.
